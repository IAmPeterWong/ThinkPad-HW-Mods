# ThinkPad Hardware Mods
This repository contains all the mods for hardware I will be releasing publicly. There is a possibility that I will sell these if there is interest for any of them.

If you would like me to possibly sell these hardware in the future, please contact me on Discord at @peter._.wong or webmaster@iampeterwong.com. You are way more likely to get a response from me on either Discord or email than anywhere else, be it Reddit, Bluesky or anywhere else. Reddit's Chat Request section is tucked away in some absurd location whenever they change their stupid UI every 3 months, and thus it gets somewhat difficult for me to respond from there.
